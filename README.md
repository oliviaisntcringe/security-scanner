A sophisticated security scanning tool that combines traditional vulnerability detection techniques with machine learning to identify potential security issues in web applications.

## 🔍 Features

### Completed Features
- ✅ Advanced vulnerability scanning for common security issues:
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - SQL Injection (SQLi)
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  - Local File Inclusion (LFI)
  - Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- ✅ Machine learning-based vulnerability detection
- ✅ Smart fuzzing capabilities
- ✅ Web crawling and mapping functionality
- ✅ Report generation with detailed findings
- ✅ Telegram integration for real-time notifications
- ✅ Exploit generation for confirmed vulnerabilities
- ✅ Training data generation for ML models
- ✅ Configurable scanning parameters

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required packages listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/security-scanner.git
cd security-scanner
```

2. Install dependencies:

## 🧠 Machine Learning Capabilities

The project employs several ML models to detect vulnerabilities that traditional pattern-matching might miss:

| Vulnerability | Detection Accuracy | Min Features |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| XSS           | 85%               | 35          |
| SQLi          | 82%               | 35          |
| CSRF          | 78%               | 35          |
| SSRF          | 75%               | 35          |
| LFI           | 80%               | 35          |
| RCE           | 77%               | 35          |
